# udacity-reinforcement-learning
This repository contains files used for my Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nano-degree program.
The coursework is largely done in Jupyter notebooks. The several subdirectories include files for
various lessons and homework assignments. In addition, the 'projects' subdirectory holds the large
self-directed projects required for this project.  Those projects are highlighted here.

## Project 1 - Navigation

This project uses Deep Q Learning to develop an agent that navigates a flat, rectangular world in
search of bananas.  [It is described in more detail here](projects/navigation/navigation_readme.md),
and all of the project files can be found in that same subdirectory ('projects/navigation').
