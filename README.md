# udacity-reinforcement-learning
This repository contains files used for my Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nano-degree program.
The coursework is largely done in Jupyter notebooks. The several subdirectories include files for
various lessons and homework assignments. In addition, the `projects` subdirectory holds the large
self-directed projects required for this course.  Those projects are highlighted here.

## Project 1 - Navigation

This project uses Deep Q Learning to develop an agent that navigates a flat, rectangular world in
search of bananas.  [It is described in more detail here](projects/navigation/README.md),
and all of the project files can be found in that same subdirectory (`projects/navigation`).

## Project 2 - Continuous Control

This project uses the DDPG policy method to train a two-arm robot to follow a moving target.
[It is described further here](projects/continous_ctrl/README.md), with all project files being
located in that subdirectory (`projects/continuous_ctrl`).

## Project 3 - Multi-Agent Cooperation and Competition

The final project is to build a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm that trains two agents to cooperate in a tennis-like game.
It is [described further here](projects/tennis/README.md) and is located in `projects/tennis`.
