# Provides a fixed-size replay buffer (without true priority) for randomly sampling past
# experiences. However, it recognizes experiences with large rewards as valuable,
# so will retain them when they have hit the left end of the queue.
# Assumes that the initial experiences added (until batch_size is reached) will be
# random garbage to prime the buffer, and will allow these primes to be pushed off the
# end, regardless of whether they have a good reward, and will not count them when
# reporting "good" experiences.
